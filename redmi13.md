 Operator          Description                                                  Example                  Result  

 Addition (+)  Adds two numbers or concatenates two strings                    - `5 + 3`                  `8`     
 Subtraction (-) Subtracts the right operand from the left operand             - `7 - 4`                  `3`     
 Multiplication (*) Multiplies two numbers                                    - `6 * 2`                  `12`    
 Division (/) Divides the left operand by the right operand                    - `10 / 2`                 `5`     
 Modulus (%)   Returns the remainder of division                               -`11 % 3`                  `2`     
 Exponentiation (**) Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand -`2 ** 3`                  `8`     
 Increment (++)  Increases the value of a variable by 1                        -`let x = 5; x++;`         `6`     
 Decrement (--)  Decreases the value of a variable by 1                        - `let x = 5; x--;`        `4`     

Remember, these operators can be used with variables, constants, or literal values. The order of operations can be controlled using parentheses.


Question-2 Ecxplain comparison Opertors in Javascripit?
Ans-
Certainly! Here's a table summarizing the comparison operators in JavaScript:

 Operator       Description                                                                                 Example                   Result  

  
Equal (==) Checks if two values are equal (with type coercion)|                                            `5 == "5"`                `true`    
Strict Equal (===)Checks if two values are equal (without type coercion)                                   `5 === "5"`              `false` 
Not Equal (!=)  Checks if two values are not equal (with type coercion)                                    `5 != "5"`               `false` 
Strict Not Equal (!==)  Checks if two values are not equal (without type coercion)                         `5 !== "5"`              `true`  
 Greater Than (>)  Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand                            `10 > 5`                 `true`  
Less Than (<)  Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand                                   `10 < 5`                 `false` 
Greater Than or Equal To (>=)  Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand    `10 >= 10`               `true`  
Less Than or Equal To (<=)  Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand          `10 <= 5`                `false` 

These operators are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of your JavaScript programs based on the comparison results. Keep in mind the difference between the regular equality operators (`==` and `!=`) that perform type coercion, and the strict equality operators (`===` and `!==`) that do not.
